    "\n",
    "- Go to lecture and sections, and also go over the relevant text sections and discussion sections before starting on the homework. You should not expect to simply remember all the ideas and details from what you heard in class.\n",
    "- Work on some of the chapter exercises before starting the homework.\n",
    "- Attempt the homework problems by yourself with the text and section work at hand. The step above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",
    "- At this point, seek help if you need it. Don't ask how to do the problem — ask how to get started, or explain where you are stuck and ask for a nudge to get you past that point.\n",
    "- For a good measure of your understanding, keep track of the fraction of the homework you can do by yourself or with minimal help. It's a better measure than your homework score, and only you can measure it.\n",
    "- **Draw lots of diagrams. They are really helpful, as in this homework where a Venn diagram or two might save you a headache.**"

    "- Every answer should contain a calculation, reasoning, or diagrams that are clearly labeled to show what's going on. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)0.8 + (2/3)0.7$ or ```sum([(1/3)*0.8, (2/3)*0.7])``` is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just $\\binom{5}{2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",

    "## 3. Leibniz's Error ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The German philosopher and mathematician [Gottfried von Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) came up with the ideas of calculus, independently of Isaac Newton. Leibniz was also interested in probability, and while his name is associated with many fundamentally important areas of mathematics, it is also associated with an unfortunate statement about chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider rolling two dice and adding up the total number of spots you get. Leibniz called these \"points\", so that for example if both dice show one spot then you get two points. \n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Imagine one of the dice to be blue and the other one gold, and let an outcome consist of the pair of faces that appear. How many possible outcomes does the experiment have? You can reason by a calculation, or by listing all the outcomes, or by displaying them in a suitable table, or any unambiguous method of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** In 1768, Leibniz wrote in his *Opera Omnia* that, \"... for example, with two dice, it is equally likely to throw twelve points, than to throw 11; because one or the other can be done in only one manner.\" Assume as Leibniz did that both dice are fair and that therefore all the outcomes in Part **a** are equally likely. Find $P(\\text{11 points})$ as well as $P(\\text{12 points})$ and explain why the answer is not what Leibniz wrote. \n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** It appears that Leibniz didn't take the time to actually roll two dice over and over again and keep track of the number of points. You don't have to either. Just extend the calculation that you did in Part **b** to find the distribution of probabilities for the number of points that result from the experiment. Display your answer in a table that has two rows. The top row should consist of all the possible numbers of points, in increasing order. The bottom row should contain the corresponding probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of such a \"distribution table\", here is one that displays the distribution of probabilities of points if the experiment consisted of rolling just one die.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Number of points $n$|$1$|$2$|$3$|$4$|$5$|$6$|\n",
    "|---------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "|P($n$ points)|$\\frac{1}{6}$|$\\frac{1}{6}$|$\\frac{1}{6}$|$\\frac{1}{6}$|$\\frac{1}{6}$|$\\frac{1}{6}$|\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed your table, you will see why the distribution is called *triangular*."
